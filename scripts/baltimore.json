The majority of abandoned vehicles, scofflaw vehicles and cars that are towed as a result of an accident or police activity are taken to the Main Impound Storage Facility. Vehicles that are illegally parked along major city gateways during peak hours (rush hour) are placed at the Fallsway lot for up to 48 hours. If the vehicle is not retrieved from the facility within 48 hours, it is then moved to the Pulaski Highway lot where storage fees may be assessed. Vehicles remaining at the Fallsway facility by the close of business each Friday will also be moved to Pulaski Highway.","title":"DOT Towing","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/k78j-azhn/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/k78j-azhn/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/k78j-azhn/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/k78j-azhn/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode","theme":["Transportation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/d/bcxw-m234","issued":"2015-11-23","modified":"2015-11-23","keyword":["liquor","event","festival","license","permit"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"publisher":{"name":"data.baltimorecity.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/bcxw-m234","description":"One Day Liquor Licenses","title":"One Day Liquor Licenses","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/bcxw-m234/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/bcxw-m234/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/bcxw-m234/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/bcxw-m234/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode","theme":["City Services"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/d/n4ma-fj3m","issued":"2015-11-23","modified":"2015-11-23","keyword":["fine","parking","citation"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"publisher":{"name":"data.baltimorecity.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/n4ma-fj3m","description":"Information on parking citations issued within the City of Baltimore.

The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of\nEducation due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files\nprovided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct\ncomparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.","title":"Education and Youth 2010","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/grrd-c7p6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/grrd-c7p6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/grrd-c7p6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/grrd-c7p6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode","theme":["Neighborhoods"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/d/gsze-vqaj","issued":"2014-04-03","modified":"2014-10-28","keyword":["transit","environment","census"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"publisher":{"name":"data.baltimorecity.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/gsze-vqaj","description":"Baltimore City is home to many green spaces, parks, and waterways. Some of the more widely recognized locations include the Inner Harbor, Middle Branch, Druid Hill , Gwynns Falls and Herring Run Parks. City residents in particular value access to green spaces as a place to recreate, exercise and congregate, but the City’s green spaces serve a vital role in ensuring clean air and water for long term urban\nsustainability. Baltimore neighborhoods actively participate in increasing access to green spaces through tree planting and other watershed protection activities such as stream clean-ups. Urban living also enables residents the option to choose alternative means of transportation to reduce vehicle miles traveled by car. The City is already served by numerous modes of mass transit including MARC, metro, light rail, the Charm City Circulator, and bus lines. BNIA-JFI tracks eight indicators to measure the City’s urban environment and transit.

Managed by the Planning Section, BikeBaltimore includes anything bike related including implementing the Bicycle Master Plan, incorporating cycling in many transportation projects, installing bike racks and coordinating cycling events. The Bicycle Master Plan was developed by the Department of Planning in 2006. With the implementation of the Bicycle Master Plan, more bike facilities are appearing on city streets. There are many different types of bike facilities. Bike Lane: an area designated for bike travel only. The bike lane is a 5’ wide lane with a bike symbol indicating that only bikes should use that lane, Sharrow: A roadway which is shared by bikes and automobiles. Cars should treat bikes as vehicles in the lane and pass when it is safe to do so, Signed Route: A roadway with no pavement markings, signed routes are used on low-traffic volume streets where cyclists can “take the lane”. Cars should pass bikes when it is safe to do so. Signed routes typically have mileage and destination markers with route adjustments along the way, Floating Bike Lane: Used along off-peak temporary parking, floating bike lanes adjust to the presence of parked cars. If parked cars are not present, cyclists occupy the 5’ bike lane along the curb. When parked cars are present, the cyclist travels in the designated area between the parked cars and vehicular travel lanes, Share The Road: When space does not exist for bike lanes, “SHARE THE ROAD” signs are installed to remind motorists that cyclists may be present.

These indicators are grouped into the following seven categories: student enrollment and demographics; dropout rate and high school completion; student attendance, suspensions and expulsions; elementary and middle school student achievement; high school performance; youth labor force participation; and youth civic engagement. The source of data for the Education and Youth section is provided by the Baltimore City Public School System, the American Community Survey and the Baltimore City Board of Elections. The data provided by the Baltimore City Public Schools includes student address, which allows BNIA-JFI to present data on educational performance by the neighborhood in which the student lives, not by the school attended. This allows BNIA-JFI to examine the relationship between community conditions and educational performance. Education and Youth indicators may not be directly comparable to data provided by either the Baltimore City Public School System or the Maryland Department of Education due to several reasons including differences in methodology used to create indicators, excluding students who cannot be matched between data files provided by BCPSS, and excluding students whose home address cannot be geocoded. In the 2009-2010 school year, 3.4% of the student addresses could not be matched or geocoded. This means that these students were not included in our analysis and not included in calculations for the City as a whole and therefore direct comparisons to data and results available through the Baltimore City Public Schools and the Maryland Report Card cannot be made.","title":"Education and Youth 2010 - Shape","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/efa9-mewy?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/efa9-mewy?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/efa9-mewy?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/efa9-mewy?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/xkf9-5pfi/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/xkf9-5pfi/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode","theme":["Neighborhoods"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/d/hbs9-bbye","issued":"2013-02-26","modified":"2014-04-05","keyword":["transit","environment","census"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"publisher":{"name":"data.baltimorecity.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/hbs9-bbye","description":"Baltimore City is home to many green spaces, parks, and waterways. Some of the more widely recognized locations include the Inner Harbor, Middle Branch, Druid Hill , Gwynns Falls and Herring Run Parks. City residents in particular value access to green spaces as a place to recreate, exercise and congregate, but the City’s green spaces serve a vital role in ensuring clean air and water for long term urban sustainability. Baltimore neighborhoods actively participate in increasing access to green spaces through tree planting and other watershed protection activities such as stream clean-ups. Urban living also enables residents the option to choose alternative means of transportation to reduce vehicle miles traveled by car. The City is already served by numerous modes of mass transit including MARC, metro, light rail, the Charm City Circulator, and bus lines. BNIA-JFI tracks eight indicators to measure the City’s urban environment and transit.

Storm surge zones have been developed for category 1-4 hurricanes represented by the Saffir-Simpson Scale. The storm surge zones data used in this application were generated using the Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model. SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features. The SLOSH MOM data is utilized. MOM is the \"Maximum of Maximum or \"Meows Of Meows\". MOM output represents the highest water level or the \"worst case scenario\" for the entire Slosh basin.","title":"Hurricane Inundation Zone","distribution":[{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/vanx-ubga?method=export&format=KML","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/vanx-ubga?method=export&format=KMZ","mediaType":"application/vnd.google-earth.kmz"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/vanx-ubga?method=export&format=Shapefile","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/geospatial/vanx-ubga?method=export&format=Original","mediaType":"application/zip"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/p5v4-e4x8/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"downloadURL":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/p5v4-e4x8/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"}],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/legalcode","theme":["Geographic"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/d/fgn8-nd4r","issued":"2012-10-23","modified":"2014-04-05","keyword":["transit","circulator","transportation"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"<Nobody>","hasEmail":"mailto:"},"publisher":{"name":"data.baltimorecity.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.baltimorecity.gov/api/views/fgn8-nd4r","description":"Shows the location of all Charm City Circulator stops.
